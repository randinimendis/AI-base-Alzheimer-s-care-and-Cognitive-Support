### Member 3 - IT21215292 - Madhusanka J.A.A. (ashen0909)/ Component 3 - Visual and Auditory Reminders on Adherence to Daily Routines in Alzheimer's Patients
### Member 4 - IT21231100 - Sandaruwan W.M.I.M. (ImalMS)/ Component 4 -Emotional Well-being for Alzheimer's Patients through AI-Driven Personalization and Social Connections

#### This research aims to develop an AI-powered smartphone application to improve the quality of life for Alzheimer's patients and their caregivers by leveraging advanced technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and machine learning. The app offers a comprehensive solution by integrating cognitive tracking, emotional well-being support, and routine management into one platform. It includes features like Cognitive Activity Monitoring, which tracks patients' cognitive abilities using tasks like the Clock-Drawing Test and Cube & Pyramid Copying Task, as well as Emotional Well-being Support, which uses AI-driven mood analysis to provide personalized recommendations like music therapy and social interaction prompts. Additionally, the app helps patients adhere to their daily routines and medication schedules with visual and auditory reminders, along with an innovative medicine photo recognition system.
